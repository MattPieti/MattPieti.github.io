title: Simulated Maze
description: Built a custom PCB to connect to an Arduino ATmega328P, then used assembly (AVR) to implement a maze. Designed a flowchart solution and translated it into a 4-state finite state machine with subroutines and indirect addressing. Final code also counted how many "bees" the "bear" encountered in the maze.
skills:
  - Arduino
  - Assembly
  - Indirect addressing
  - Soldering
  - PCBs
