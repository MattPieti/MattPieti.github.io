title: Ball-and-Plate Platform
description:  Created a 2-DOF touchscreen PID control platform using an Arduino UNO to autonomously center a metal ball. Compatibility was added for a handheld controller, allowing modes to be switched for pre-programmed movement patterns and manual joystick control within a $150 budget.

## Summary


Worked in a 3-person team to research and develop the platform, inspired by Stewart platform technology, within one semester. 10 specifications were designated before development started, all of which were met or exceeded. Design process included debugging through MATLAB simulations and physical testing. Presented results to classmate and teacher. As a mock business proposal, "pitched device" as a prototype amusement park ride.


## Modes

### Mode 1: Ball balancing
