title: Ball-and-Plate Platform
description:  Created a 2-DOF touchscreen PID control platform using an Arduino UNO to autonomously center a metal ball. Compatibility was added for a handheld controller, allowing modes to be switched for pre-programmed movement patterns and manual joystick control within a $150 budget.

## Modes

### Mode 1: Ball balancing



### Mode 2: Joystick movement + balancing



### Mode 3: Joystick re-centering



### Mode 4: Automatic circular movement



### Mode 5: Automatic "bow tie" movement



### Bonus Mode: Movements without ball



## Stewart platform technology example: AMiBA radio telescope
