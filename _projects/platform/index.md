title: Ball-and-Plate Platform
description:  Created a 2-DOF touchscreen PID control platform using an Arduino UNO to autonomously center a metal ball. Compatibility was added for a handheld controller, allowing modes to be switched for pre-programmed movement patterns and manual joystick control within a $150 budget.
