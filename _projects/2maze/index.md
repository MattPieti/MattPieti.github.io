title: Simulated Maze
description: Built a custom PCB to connect to an Arduino ATmega328P, then used assembly (AVR) to implement a maze. Designed a flowchart solution and translated it into a 4-state finite state machine with subroutines and indirect addressing. Final code also counted how many "bees" the "bear" encountered in the maze.

## "Arduino Proto-Shield" PCB

This custom PCB was built by soldering 30 parts according to instructions from the lab manual. It worked first try without errors despite the manual's warning that it probably wouldn't. The PCB could not be located to take a picture, so the images below are from the manual.

## Project Summary
<br>
### Introduction
<br>
This was a lab project done for EE346: Microprocessor Principles and Applications. The project spanned the entire semester. Individual project parts were done as 6 lab assignments with pre-labs.
<br>
The goal of this project was to simulate a bear traversing a 20-by-20 maze with each square in the maze grid represented by an ordered pair in hexadecimal. Some squares contained bees with a number indicating how many were there. All programming was done in AVR Assembly
<br>
### Part 1: Individual path and flowchart
<br>
Following lab instructions, I used my student ID number to find my individual "target square" with a solution that crossed through this target square. I had to come as close to 15 bees as possible, but no more.
<br>
After finding my solution, I represented it as a flowchart.
