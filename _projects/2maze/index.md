title: Simulated Maze
description: Built a custom PCB to connect to an Arduino ATmega328P, then used assembly (AVR) to implement a maze. Designed a flowchart solution and translated it into a 4-state finite state machine with subroutines and indirect addressing. Final code also counted how many "bees" the "bear" encountered in the maze.
skills:
  - Arduino
  - Assembly
  - Indirect addressing
  - Subroutines
  - Soldering
  - PCBs

## "Arduino Proto-Shield" PCB 
<br>
This custom PCB was built by soldering 30 parts according to instructions from the lab manual. It worked first try without errors despite the manual's warning that it probably wouldn't. The PCB could not be located to take a picture, so the images below are from the manual.
