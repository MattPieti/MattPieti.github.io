## "Arduino Proto-Shield" PCB

This custom PCB was built by soldering 30 parts according to instructions from the lab manual. It worked first try without errors despite the manual's warning that it probably wouldn't. Images below are from the manual.

## Project Summary



### Introduction


This was a lab project done for EE346: Microprocessor Principles and Applications. The project spanned the entire semester. Individual project parts were done as 6 lab assignments with pre-labs.
  
  
The goal of this project was to simulate a bear traversing a 20-by-20 maze with each square in the maze grid represented by an ordered pair in hexadecimal. Some squares contained bees with a number indicating how many were there. All programming was done in AVR Assembly

### Part 1: Individual path and flowchart


Found a "target square" based on my ID. Designed a maze solution where the bear passes through the target square and as close as possible to 15 bees without going over. Represented solution as a flowchart.


### Part 2:


Wrote code to perform some simple calculations and test board functions. This was the first lab completed after circuit assembly.
