## Summary

After performing well in EE202, a MATLAB course, I was invited by the teacher to join a small group of students researching wearable biomedical technology. We were split into smaller subgroups to study individual components. I was paired with one other student to study accelerometers and their role in activity recognition.



After some research, we assembled and soldered a simple PCB with an accelerometer to connect to an Arduino, creating a system that outputs three dimensions of acceleration data, averages, and standard deviations to a computer. The results formed a prototype activity recognition system.



We regularly presented our findings to the larger group throughout the semester. The research ultimately resulted in the [BioMeSensi](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2737095.2742920) device, though the undergraduates' contributions were not significant enough for us to be credited.
