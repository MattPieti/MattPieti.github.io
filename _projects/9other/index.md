## Control Systems


In a small group, used a custom board provided by the school for various projects. The board used a BASIC Stamp microcontroller and projects were programmed in PBASIC. Projects include a photoresistor light alarm, transistor switch, opto-reflector-based tachometer, pulse width modulated fan, opamp buffer and filter, and open-loop control heater.

## Digital Image Processing


Used MATLAB to perform image processing tasks, such as one of the pixelation programs seen on my [projects](https://mattpieti.github.io/projects/) page. Other projects in this course include generating and filtering out noise, and thresholding, and edge detection.

## Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Simulations


Used MATLAB to simulate DSP concepts including sinusoidal and complex exponential signals, beamforming, Shepard scales, analog-to-digital sampling, digital-to-analog reconstruction, convolution, and FIR filtering. Designed Simulink block diagrams to simulate MAC operations, FIR filters, and quantization. In a small group, used CCS and a C5505 eZdsp stick to convert 8-bit PCM data into 16-bit integer data, multiply integers, multiply complex numbers, and partially design an FIR filter, an IIR filter, and a 128-point decimation-in-frequency fast fourier transform.

## Probability Simulations & Stochastic Modeling


Used MATLAB to simulate real-world examples of probability concepts including Gaussian, Binomial, and Poisson distributions, least-squares-fit, probability density, standard deviation, the central limit theorem, and confidence bounds. Results were shown visually, such as with histograms.

---

## Electromagnetic Simulations


Used MATLAB to simulate electromagnetic interactions in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates, including electric fields, equipotentials, magnetic flux and induction, EM waves, and attenuation.

---

## Analog Electronic Circuit Labs


In a small group, assembled electronic circuits to study various types of diodes, transistors, and circuits that can be made with them. Used oscilloscopes and digital multimeters. Designed LTspice and PSPICE circuit simulations to further study electronics, such as amplifiers.

---

## Communication System Simulations


In a small group, used MATLAB and Simulink to design simulations of communication systems, such as AM modulation and demodulation and LTI filters. In a later course, created simulations to study thermal noise, Gaussian random sequences, bit error rates, signal-to-noise ratios, and orthogonal/antipodal signaling.

---

## Digital System Designs in VHDL


Used Xilinx ISE and a Nexys FPGA board to program digital logic circuits such as a 3-to-8 decoder, a 4-bit universal shift register, and a 4-bit adder.

---

## RLC Circuit Labs


Assembled RLC circuits to study principles such as Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Laws. Used lab equipment to measure resistance and current and compare with nominal values.

---

## Introductory MATLAB Projects


Completed various projects to learn MATLAB, most significantly a project about grouping 1,000 3-dimensional data points into density boxes and plotting a surface along their centers. Helped my classmates understand and complete the project. Invited by the teacher of this class to join him for research the following semester.

---

## Breadboard Circuits


Used digital logic to design schematics for simple circuits such as binary adders and implemented them via breadboards.
