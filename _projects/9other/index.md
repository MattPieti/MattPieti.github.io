## Control Systems


In a group, used a custom board provided by the school for various projects. The board used a BASIC Stamp microcontroller and projects were programmed in PBASIC. Project results include a functioning photoresistor, 

---

## Digital Image Processing


Used MATLAB to perform image processing tasks, such as one of the pixelation programs seen on my [projects](https://mattpieti.github.io/#projects) page. Other projects in this course include generating and filtering out noise, and thresholding, and edge detection.

---

## Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Simulations


Used MATLAB to simulate DSP concepts including sinusoidal and complex exponential signals, beamforming, Shepard scales, analog-to-digital sampling, digital-to-analog reconstruction, convolution, and FIR filtering.

---

## Probability Simulations & Stochastic Modeling


Used MATLAB to simulate real-world examples of probability concepts including Gaussian, Binomial, and Poisson distributions, least-squares-fit, probability density, standard deviation, the central limit theorem, and confidence bounds. Results were shown visually, such as with histograms.

---

## Electromagnetic Simulations


Used MATLAB to simulate electromagnetic interactions in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates, including electric fields, equipotentials, magnetic flux and induction, EM waves, and attenuation.

---

## Analog Electronic Circuit Labs


As part of a group, assembled electronic circuits to study various types of diodes, transistors, and circuits that can be made with them. Used oscilloscopes and digital multimeters. In a later course, designed LTspice to further study electronics, such as amplifiers.

---

## Communication System Simulations


As part of a group, used MATLAB and Simulink to design simulations of communication systems, such as AM modulation and demodulation and LTI filters. In a later course, created simulations to study thermal noise, Gaussian random sequences, bit error rates, signal-to-noise ratios, and orthogonal/antipodal signaling.

---

## Digital System Designs in VHDL


Used Xilinx ISE and a Nexys FPGA board to program digital logic circuits such as a 3-to-8 decoder, a 4-bit universal shift register, and a 4-bit adder.

---

## RLC Circuit Labs


Assembled RLC circuits to study principles such as Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Laws. Used lab equipment to measure resistance and current and compare with nominal values.

---

## Introductory MATLAB Projects


Completed various projects to learn MATLAB, most significantly a project about grouping 1,000 3-dimensional data points into density boxes and plotting a surface along their centers. Helped my classmates understand and complete the project. Was asked by the teacher of this class to join him for research the following semester.

---

## Breadboard Circuits


Used digital logic to design schematics for simple circuits such as binary adders and implemented them via breadboards.
