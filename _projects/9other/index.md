## Left off on Semester 7. Still need to add EE360 and EE380.


stuff

---

## Analog Electronic Circuit Labs


As part of a group, assembled electronic circuits to study various types of diodes, transistors, and circuits that can be made with them. Used oscilloscopes and digital multimeters.

---

## Communication System Simulations


As part of a group, used MATLAB and Simulink to design simulations of communication systems, such as AM modulation and demodulation and LTI filters.

---

## Digital System Designs in VHDL


Used Xilinx ISE and a Nexys FPGA board to program digital logic circuits such as a 3-to-8 decoder, a 4-bit universal shift register, and a 4-bit adder.

---

## RLC Circuit Labs


Assembled RLC circuits to study principles such as Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Laws. Used lab equipment to measure resistance and current and compare with nominal values.

---

## Introductory MATLAB projects


Completed various projects to learn MATLAB, most significantly a project about grouping 1,000 3-dimensional data points into density boxes and plotting a surface along them. Helped my classmates understand and complete the project. Was asked by the teacher of this class to join him for research the following semester.

## Breadboard Circuits


Used digital logic to design schematics for simple circuits such as binary adders and implemented them via breadboards.
